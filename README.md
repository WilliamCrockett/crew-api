# Welcome to Coach
## A simple web app designed to help you manage your training sessions
### Currently designed for the RSA Olympic Sailing team. I plan to extend it to other sports in the future.

## Technologies Used:

* Ruby
* Rails
* PostgreSQL

## Premise

I was tasked with writing a full-stack web app as project for Web Development Bootcamp.
After 5 years of running various sailing teams, I identified the need for a simple web app to
manage the situation. Even if just for myself, I thought it would be a fun project to attempt.

## Known issues

* refreshing the bowser ends current session, forcing you to log in again.


## Future release roadmap:

* Local storage to persist information in the event of an accidental browser
refresh
* When editing an event, ability to add/change the crew members (before event date has past)
* Adding general boat info and populating PDF export with that information
* Integrating with a 3rd party API for digital document signing
* Sorting of tables
* Advanced 'crew-based' queries to see which crew members have sailed which event
* Ability for a single user to manage multiple boats/teams
